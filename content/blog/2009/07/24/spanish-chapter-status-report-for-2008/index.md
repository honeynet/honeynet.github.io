**DEPLOYMENTS**

  

  
2. List current technologies deployed.  
    
      
    - Design of a new honeypot platform based on web technologies called Honeyweb. It basically analyzes network traffic using pattern detection techniques and redirects malicious activities to a honeypot.
      
    - Deployment of a wireless honeypot (HoneySpot).
      
    
      
    
  
4. Activity timeline: Highlight attacks, compromises, and interesting information collected.
  

  

**RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT**

  

  
2. List any new tools, projects or ideas you are currently researching or developing.  
    
  
4. List tools you enhanced during the last year
  
6. Would you like to integrate this with any other tools, or you  
      
    looking for help or collaboration with others in testing or developing  
      
    the tool?
  
8. Explain what kind of help or tools or collaboration you are interested in.
  

  

**FINDINGS**

  

  
2. Highlight any unique findings, attacks, tools, or methods.
  
4. Any trends seen in the past year?

2. Are you working on or did you publish any papers or presentations,  
      
    such as KYE or academic papers?  If yes, please provide a description
  
4. 
    and link (if possible).Are you looking for any data or people to help with your papers?
  
6. Where did you present honeypot-related material? ( selected publications ).
