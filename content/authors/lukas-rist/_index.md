After spending a couple of years studying Math and Physics, Lukas ventured out to work with Microsoftâ€™s Bing on making the web a safer place, got paid by DARPA to hunt hackers and taught students in Taiwan. His passion for security and open source got nurtured by The Honeynet Project which lead to a five year stint with Norman, Blue Coat and Symantec working on large scale malware analysis and behavioral detection systems. Looking for higher purpose, he worked as Senior Software Engineer at Corti, striving to build a great engineering team and making sure those tensors keep flowing in order to classify life threatening situations. Currently Lukas is working as Senior Engineering Manager with the world largest online wine retail platform Vivino.
